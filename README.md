Using quantum computing to help reduce time/space complexity when computing molecular topography

This is something I am working on during my free time. As of now, I'm in the data collection and mapping phase, which is to say
I think a lot about this problem and how to solve it, but am limited in my knowledge of q-computing and so have yet to write any code for it. 

I feel like there is progress to be made by the infusion of quantum computing into bioinformatics, particularly at the quatum scale, if for nothing else than they both operate with some degree of uncertainty. I'm reading research now and learning more about quantum computing so that someday I can turn this project into something tangible. As of now this repo just holds some of my research materials. 

I'm building a small cluster of computers to run simulations on and should have something written for that cluster by year's end.
Along the way I hope to learn more about Tensorflow and Keras, along with any other helpful libraries or toolsets (like the IBM quantum computing API).
